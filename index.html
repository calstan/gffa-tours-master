            <hr>
            <p>Coruscant, formerly known as Imperial Center, was named for the planet's resemblence to a Corusca gem as the lights of the planet-wide Galactic City never go out. Even during the Clone Wars, when the capital was under direct attack by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the lights of Coruscant represented the light of democracy that would never be extinguished.</p>
            <p>With the fall of the Galactic Empire, Coruscant was restored as a key planet in the New Republic. Imperial sympathizers are still known troublemakers, but Triple Zero, as it's known for its galactic coordinates, is a must see no matter what the circumstances.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>On the forest moon of Endor, the Alliance to Restore the Republic found their greatest challenge, and won a decisive victory against the Galactic Empire's Death Star II, the Executor armada, and the Emperor himself. The Alliance fleet, led by Admiral Ackbar, defeated the Empire's most powerful fleet and its most experienced commanders.</p>
            <p>In the years since the Battle of Endor, the forest moon has become a quietly successful tourist location, with the native Ewok populations welcoming travellers looking for a less-pampered adventure. The natural beauty of the forest moon is huge draw, no matter what your political leanings.</p>

            <h6>Luxury in the Clouds</h6>
            <hr>
            <p>Bespin was an immense gas giant located in the vicinity of the Anoat system, in a little-visited sector of the galaxy. Bespin had several moons, and its gaseous mass contained a thin stratum of habitable atmosphere. Its layers were a source of rare Tibanna gas, which was harvested and refined in several mining complexes, including Cloud City, an opulent metropolis suspended in the planet's huge billowing clouds. </p>
            <p>The Ugnaught city of Ugnorgrad also was located over the planet, being ruled by King Ozz in the time after the Battle of Endor. During the Galactic Civil War, Bespin remained unaffiliated, but that did not prevent the Galactic Empire from garrisoning the planet and seizing Cloud City. However, with the Empire's defeat at Endor, the gas giant and its prosperous mining colony ended up recovering their freedom.</p>

            <p>Corellia was located in the Core Worlds. It was known for its ace pilots and large starships. Vessels such as the Millennium Falcon and Imperial starships were built on Corellia. At some point in the Imperial era, an organization known as the Corellian Resistance operated on the planet, fighting against the Galactic Empire. One of their members, Miru Nadrinakar, attempted to warn them of an upcoming crackdown.</p>
            <p>It was the homeworld of Han Solo, Wedge Antilles, the Besalisk Gadren, and the bounty hunter Dengar.</p>
